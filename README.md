## Newsies Rush

For this project I'd like to re-imagine the classic Paperboy video game!  

___


## About The Game

This game is viewed top-down as you ride through a neighborhood, delivering newspapers to the houses that have signed up, and not delivering to those who didn't want the paper - all while dodging obstacles!  If you give newspapers to people who did not request them, that's a lost profit!  If you throw a newspaper perfectly onto a subscribers doorstep or mailbox, you get a tip from them, increasing your score!  But don't just go as fast as you can - some houses have junk in their yards, some may even have dogs that chase you!
